## Ally 1.4 Goals

The focus for Ally 1.4 is to enhance then experience of using the current features.

While a lot of new stuff will be added, the focus is not on features.

The focus is on reducing clutter, and using what's given, instead of complaining when something is just a little off.

The biggest goals for Ally 1.4 are:

- Improved speed
- Improved functionality
- Lighter weight

The status of those goals: **Awesome**

- On average, 1.4 loads 3ms faster then 1.3.
- The new event system opens up a whole world of opportunities.
- Ally 1.4 is 12KB smaller then 1.3.

Ally 1.4 is expected to be ready for distribution by the end of June.

Please enjoy the prerelease versions in the mean time. :)
