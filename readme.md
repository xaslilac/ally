# Ally Framework

Ally is a JavaScript library that I originally made when I was like 12, and was teaching
myself to program. It was inspired by libraries of the time such as jQuery, Prototype, and
Mootools. I was fascinated with those libraries back then, but didn't really get how to use
them, though I did understand what the were for and what they tried to accomplish. It
seemed easier to just try and duplicate the functionality myself than to just learn how to
use one or all of them, so that's what I did.

The earliest versions of it are... comically bad, but some of the later versions actually
had some interesting ideas and aren't _that_ bad. You should still definitely not ever use
it for anything. You probably shouldn't use jQuery or the like anymore though, either.

I've kept copies of all the old versions around for a long while. I think I used to have a
Github repo for it way way back, but it's been lost to time. Rather than just have it
hidden away on my computer, I've decided to restore what I can and put it on Github again.

## Ally 1.4 Goals

The focus for Ally 1.4 is to enhance then experience of using the current features.

While a lot of new stuff will be added, the focus is not on features.

The focus is on reducing clutter, and using what's given, instead of complaining when something is just a little off.

The biggest goals for Ally 1.4 are:

-   Improved speed
-   Improved functionality
-   Lighter weight

The status of those goals: **Awesome**

-   On average, 1.4 loads 3ms faster then 1.3.
-   The new event system opens up a whole world of opportunities.
-   Ally 1.4 is 12KB smaller then 1.3.

Ally 1.4 is expected to be ready for distribution by the end of June.

Please enjoy the prerelease versions in the mean time. :)
