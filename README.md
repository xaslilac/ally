# Ally Framework

Ally is a JavaScript library that I originally made when I was like 12, and was teaching
myself to program. It was inspired by libraries of the time such as jQuery, Prototype, and
Mootools. I was fascinated with those libraries back then, but didn't really get how to use
them, though I did understand what the were for and what they tried to accomplish. It
seemed easier to just try and duplicate the functionality myself than to just learn how to
use one or all of them, so that's what I did.

The earliest versions of it are... comically bad, but some of the later versions actually
had some interesting ideas and aren't _that_ bad. You should still definitely not ever use
it for anything. You probably shouldn't use jQuery or the like anymore though, either.

I've kept copies of all the old versions around for a long while. I think I used to have a
Github repo for it way way back, but it's been lost to time. Rather than just have it
hidden away on my computer, I've decided to restore what I can and put it on Github again.
